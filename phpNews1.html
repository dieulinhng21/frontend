				<h5>PHP Is a Scripting Language</h5>
				<p>PHP (an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a scripting language that’s generally used in “server-side” web development.
					(Don’t worry, I’ll explain exactly what this means below.) In order to sort it all out, it’s crucial to first understand
					what a scripting language is. Scripting languages (a family of programming languages including PHP as well as languages
					like JavaScript and Ruby) are a subset of coding languages used to automate processes that otherwise would need to be
					executed step-by-step in a site’s code every time they occur.</p>

					executed step-by-step in a site’s code every time they occur.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h5>PHP Is Used For Server-Side Scripting</h5>
				<p>As mentioned previously, PHP is typically used as a server-side language (as opposed to a language like JavaScript that’s
					generally executed on the client-side). So what does that mean? In programming terms, client-side refers to website
					activity that takes place locally on a user’s computer through the user’s web browser. Client-side languages like HTML,
					CSS, and JavaScript give instructions that web browsers can parse and translate into content on your computer screen.
					Notice JavaScript (a scripting language like PHP) is on that list. Again, the processes scripted by JavaScript take
					place on the client-side—JS provides instructions that can be understood by and executed in your web browser. Client-side
					is the side you see when you’re using the internet.</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, server-side activity involves a web browser sending requests to a web server (the software or hardware
					that stores a websites pages, images, media, and other assets), which then responds to the request with HTML code that
					can be processed and rendered by the web browser and turned into content on the user’s screen. The main difference here
					from client-side activity is the fact that this process involves communication with a server and isn’t completed entirely
					within the client’s browser. In other words, a client-side scripting language like JavaScript can automate tasks involving
					content that’s already available to a user in their web browser, but a server-side scripting language like PHP is used
					to request content from a website’s server or database and make that content visible and accessible for the site’s user.
					In order to maintain website efficiency, loading speeds, and storage capacity, not all assets can be stored locally
					on web pages at all times.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, a PHP script can make your three most recent blog posts appear automatically on your site’s front page. In this
					instance, the posts themselves are stored on the site’s server and called up when they occupy one of the three most
					recently published slots. This avoids both preloading the posts on your site and necessitating a site admin to load
					and update the posts when new stories are published. PHP scripts can also involve conditional (if/else/endif) statements
					that direct your site to change its display and add content from your web server as needed. This can include actions
					such as dictating that if the site administrator uploads a video link to “x” field, then the site will load the video
					from its server and display it for the user. The script can further state that if the admin does not upload a link,
					then the page will show “y” default image instead. PHP’s server-side actions introduce a whole new level of dynamic
					possibilities to a website (above and beyond the static features offered by HTML and CSS, and even the dynamic client-side
					content made possible by JavaScript).
				</p>
				<h5>PHP and WordPress</h5>
				<p>
					PHP’s functionality plays a particularly large role when it comes to WordPress development. While it’s possible to build
					functional WordPress sites without knowing PHP, PHP is the engine behind custom WordPress themes and plugins. When creating
					these kinds of custom WordPress features, PHP is the scripting language used to communicate with the WordPress site’s
					server and deliver requested content and actions to the user’s screen. If you build a WordPress site using template
					themes and plugins you’ll still be passively implementing PHP, but in order to create your own themes, plugins, or alter
					WordPress’ default behavior, you’ll need to develop hands-on PHP skills. WordPress—a content management system that
					allows you to create and publish digital content online—is a particularly attractive platform for web development since
					its learning curve make room for complete beginners (who can rely on menu options and default templates), but it keeps
					the door open for advanced users who can take advantage of PHP and create a more custom experience for clients. Learning
					your way around WordPress basics alone will already put you in position to do paid WordPress developer work, but learning
					PHP will make you that much more qualified to carve out a niche as a serious WordPress developer.
				</p>
				<p>The takeaway here is that—while PHP isn’t ahead of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the list of must-learn web developer
					skills—it’s a skill that anyone looking to round out a developer toolkit should definitely consider adding to their
					arsenal. It’s certainly possible to build static websites with only HTML and CSS (and to build websites with dynamic
					content using JavaScript), but introducing a server-side language into the mix will drastically increase the kinds of
					websites you can tackle and clients you can land. PHP in particular will also give you access to the lucrative world
					of WordPress customization. And so—when it comes to the alphabet soup of coding languages—PHP are three letters you
					should definitely keep in mind.
